DESCRIPTION
	The idea of combining multiple files together to speed up page 
	rendering was first brought in perlbal, by David Davis. Then mod_concat
	was implemented	by Ian Holsman at AOL. This technique is really simple
	but very useful, by specifing a set of files to load in one HTTP
	request.

	This module basically works as what its apache cousin does.
	Additionally, it also support maximum concat file number setting and
	version string (the string after the third question mark will be
	treated as version string and ignored).

EXAMPLE
	http://foobar.com/??a.js,b.js,c.js
	http://foobar.com/??a.css,b.css,c.css
	http://foobar.com/??a.js,dir1/b.js,dir2/c.js
	http://foobar.com/somelocation/??1.js,2.js
	http://foobar.com/??a.js,b.js,c.js?t=20100520
